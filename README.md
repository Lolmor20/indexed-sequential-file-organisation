# indexed-sequential-file-organisation

This project was created as an assignment for Database Structures course at my university.
It's goal was to write a program implementing an algorithm for a certain file organisation (in my case it was indexed-sequential).

The record consists of lengths of pentagon's sides and a key.
The program contains methods of inserting, deleting, updating and fetching records as well as reorganising the file.
It also counts the number of reads and writes to disk.
